# README

Welcome to the Top Ten

This is a Rails application where you can create topics and lists of 5 to 10 items in that topic. These can be your favorites or recommendations for friends.

Deployment Instructions:

Note: I had to run this using Node version 14.11.0 due some issues with webpacker and javascript.


IMPORTANT:
Before launching, make sure to bundle install and migrate database.
